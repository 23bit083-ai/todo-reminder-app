The To-Do Reminder App is a simple desktop application that helps users manage daily tasks efficiently.
It allows users to add, edit, delete, search, and prioritize tasks, along with setting reminder times for each task.
When the reminder time arrives, the app plays a notification sound and shows a desktop notification, ensuring the user never misses an important task.
